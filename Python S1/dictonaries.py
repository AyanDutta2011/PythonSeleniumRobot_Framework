'''
Dict is an unordered collection of key value pairs.
Defined as {}
Key:value can be of any type.
Dict doesn't have index.
It is generally used when we have huge amount of data.
Dict are optimized for retrieving data.
We must know the key to retrieve the value.

#Create and print a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964}
print(thisdict)
x = thisdict["model"]
print(x)
x = thisdict.get("model")

#Change the "year" to 2018:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964}
thisdict["year"] = 2018

#Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)

#Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])

#You can also use the values() function to return values of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

#Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() function:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)

#Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")

#Print the number of items in the dictionary:
print(len(thisdict))

#Adding item
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

#The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

#The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)

#The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

#The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
#print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.

#The clear() keyword empties the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

#Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
print(myfamily)

#Create three dictionaries, than create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}

myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}
print(myfamily)

#It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a new dictionary:
thisdict = dict(brand="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1964)
# note that keywords are not string literals
# note the use of equals rather than colon for the assignment
print(thisdict)
